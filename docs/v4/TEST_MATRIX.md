# DigiByte ADN Shield v4 Test Matrix

Author attribution: DarekDGB

## Scope

This matrix covers the DigiByte ADN Shield v4 component-verdict contract,
ML-DSA-65 and optional draft Falcon-1024 adapters, canonical order, and the
4.0.0 candidate release-pack locks. Runtime and workflow bytes are unchanged by E5.

The goal is to prove DigiByte ADN can produce and verify v4 component evidence while keeping TEST-ONLY deterministic signatures separate from real backend mode.

## Positive Tests

| Test | Expected result |
|---|---|
| build unsigned DigiByte ADN v4 payload | deterministic payload with `contract_version: 4` |
| add required classical + ML-DSA test signatures | signed envelope validates under TEST-ONLY verifier |
| validate with matching context hash | verification summary returned |
| verify required role | `shield_component_adn` only |
| build real crypto signature input | frozen DigiByte ADN component domain bytes with authenticated `standard_profile` |
| build real ML-DSA signature entry through backend adapter | `b64u:` signature entry produced |
| verify real ML-DSA signature entry through backend adapter | verification returns true |
| lazy OQS fake backend exposes version | backend metadata includes locked mechanism |
| optional gated real-liboqs ML-DSA proof workflow | runs only with `SHIELD_V4_REAL_OQS=1` and JUnit not-skipped guard |
| shared frozen component-verdict KAT vector | canonical JSON, domain-separated bytes, and signed payload hash match the shared V4.8G-R4 fixture |
| FN-DSA signed-message KAT | `fn-dsa`, `fips206-draft-falcon1024-v1`, and component domain bytes match fixture |
| valid optional FN-DSA evidence with required signatures | accepted and recorded as optional evidence |
| bundle builder receives supported entries in noncanonical order | emits a new outer list in canonical required-first, optional-last order without mutating the caller's list |

## Required CI Gate

```text
pytest --cov=adn_v3 --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=100 -q
```


## Required Release Real-OQS Proof Gate

Default CI does not require liboqs. The live liboqs proof is a separate gated
job that executes both required guarded nodes:

```text
SHIELD_V4_REAL_OQS=1 SHIELD_V4_REAL_OQS_FALCON=1 \
python -m pytest --override-ini addopts='' \
  tests/test_v48g_real_oqs_mldsa_backend.py \
  tests/test_v48h_e_real_oqs_falcon_backend.py \
  -q --junitxml=shield-v4-real-oqs-results.xml

python scripts/assert_real_oqs_junit_not_skipped.py \
  shield-v4-real-oqs-results.xml \
  --min-tests 2 \
  --require-testcase "tests/test_v48g_real_oqs_mldsa_backend.py::test_v48g_real_oqs_mldsa65_adn_backend_round_trip_and_negatives" \
  --require-testcase "tests/test_v48h_e_real_oqs_falcon_backend.py::test_v48h_e_real_oqs_falcon1024_backend_round_trip_and_negatives"
```

The guard must prove that both exact testcase nodes ran and that `skipped == 0`,
`failures == 0`, and `errors == 0` before the run can support a live-liboqs
claim.

Ordinary CI may skip the two native modules when their gates are unset. Those
skips are not native proof. Standard and dedicated native workflows must both
pass on the exact E5 commit before fresh ZIP verification closes the step.

## V4.8G-R4 Audit Cleanup Checks

The component test suite now includes a shared frozen component-verdict KAT fixture:

```text
tests/fixtures/v4/component_verdict_policy_v1_kat.json
```

Every component repo must reproduce this signed payload hash exactly:

```text
a3881f27444ce73de875a15c8b413785a4fec4f4c03baaa6f8ee2fbf839736ae
```

The KAT is TEST-ONLY deterministic canonicalization evidence only. It does not sign transactions, broadcast, change DigiByte consensus, or claim live liboqs execution.

## V4.8H-C FN-DSA Optional Evidence Checks

The component test suite now includes:

```text
tests/test_v48h_fn_dsa_optional_evidence.py
tests/test_v48h_fn_dsa_signed_message_kat.py
tests/fixtures/v4/fn_dsa_signed_message_draft_profile_kat.json
```

These tests prove:

- FN-DSA absent + required signatures valid -> ACCEPT;
- FN-DSA valid + required signatures valid -> ACCEPT with optional evidence recorded;
- FN-DSA valid + ML-DSA invalid -> DENY;
- FN-DSA valid + classical invalid -> DENY;
- FN-DSA valid but ML-DSA missing -> DENY;
- FN-DSA invalid while present -> DENY;
- FN-DSA wrong payload hash or wrong domain -> DENY;
- FN-DSA wrong role or missing trust-profile key -> DENY;
- duplicate FN-DSA entries -> DENY;
- unsupported FN-DSA `standard_profile` -> DENY;
- `standard_profile` flipped after signing -> DENY.

## V4.8H-E Full Hybrid and Live-Falcon Checks

V4.8H-E adds these checks:

```text
tests/test_v48h_e_oqs_falcon_backend.py
tests/test_v48h_e_real_oqs_falcon_backend.py
```

The deterministic backend-contract test proves Falcon-1024 adapter wiring, `b64u:` binary material parsing, wrong-algorithm denial, disabled-mechanism denial, native exception fail-closed handling, and `standard_profile` binding.

The real-liboqs test is gated and must be run only by the dedicated PQC workflow with:

```text
SHIELD_V4_REAL_OQS=1
SHIELD_V4_REAL_OQS_FALCON=1
```

A live Falcon-1024 claim requires the dedicated PQC workflow JUnit guard to report `skipped == 0`, `failures == 0`, and `errors == 0`. FN-DSA remains optional evidence and is not final FIPS 206 proof.

## Authority Boundary

Passing these tests provides evidence for the ADN v4 component-verdict contract
and the exercised ML-DSA/Falcon-1024 adapter boundaries. Coverage applies to
adn_v3, including adn_v3.v4; it is not a full legacy adn_v2 coverage claim.

It does not grant transaction-signing authority, broadcast authority, DigiByte consensus authority, Shield Orchestrator final receipt authority, or AdamantineOS final authority.

## V4.10-E5 Release-Pack Lock

`tests/test_v410e5_release_pack_lock.py` checks distribution/compatibility
version separation, frozen identities and algorithms, KAT file hashes,
documentation links, candidate-only status, historical release wording, exact
workflow node identities, bounded crypto/authority claims, repository text and
attribution, and generated-output plus encoding-corruption regressions.

The lock must work in a normal Git checkout after editable installation and
with bytecode, pytest cache, and coverage output enabled. It rejects all C1
controls and the tested Latin-1/cp1252 corruption patterns without treating untracked
generated artifacts as repository source. Tracked generated artifacts fail.
Every E5 package member is ASCII-safe; unchanged Unicode fixtures remain frozen.
